A short program that will add roman numerals less than M.

The first line of input is a number `N` which signifies the number of lines of subsequent input to read.
Each of the following `N` lines will consist of a string of the following form:
  X+Y=0
where 0 < X,Y < 1000, and X and Y are both roman numerals.

The program will add the numbers, and output the equation and the sum in roman numerals if it is less than 1000. 
If it is greater than 1000 it will instead output "CONCORDIA CUM VERITATE", which is Waterloo's motto,
"In Harmony with Truth".
Output will therefore take the following form:
  X+Y=Z
Where X,Y,Z are roman numerals, and Z=X+Y; or:
  CONCORDIA CUM VERITATE
